            During my school days, I achieved significant academic milestones. I
            passed my 10th-grade exams in 2022 with 92% marks and completed my
            12th grade with 77%. Despite studying in a rural setting, these
            experiences taught me the value of hard work and adaptability,
            shaping a strong foundation for my future.

            Currently, I am a first-year Computer Science and Engineering
            student at Chitkara University in collaboration with Kalvium. I am
            actively learning programming and web development, focusing on tools
            like C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. This phase is both
            challenging and exciting as I work towards becoming a skilled
            software engineer.
